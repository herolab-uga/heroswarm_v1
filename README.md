This page provides you instructions in assembling your robot for the HeRoSwarm.
Before we start, take a moment to name your robot and print a label for it (You can use the label printer in the lab).
A fully assembled bot looks something like this

**Note:** You can right-click and open the image in a new page for clarity.

There are five steps in assembling this robot, and it should take anywhere from one hour to a few hours in assembling it. You can take breaks and do it on multiple days.

Steps for assembling the robot
