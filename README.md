# Welcome to the HeRoSwarm Robot Assembly wiki!


This page provides you instructions in assembling your robot for the HeRoSwarm.
Before we start, take a moment to name your robot and print a label for it (You can use the label printer in the lab).
A fully assembled bot looks something like this

**Note:** You can right click and open the image in a new page for clarity.

There are five steps in assembling this robot and it should take anywhere from one hour to 3.5 hours in assembling it. You can take breaks and do it on multiple days.

Steps for assembling the robot
---------------------------------
1. [Frame 3D Printing](http://github.com/herolab-uga/heroswarm_v1/wiki/Frame-3D-Printing)
2. [Soldering and making connections.](http://github.com/herolab-uga/heroswarm_v1/wiki/Soldering-and-Making-Connections)
3. [Assembling the frame, electronics and motors.](http://github.com/herolab-uga/heroswarm_v1/wiki/Assembling-the-frame,-electronics-and-motors)
4. [Installing software and configuring raspberry pi.](http://github.com/herolab-uga/heroswarm_v1/wiki/Installing-software-and-configuring-raspberry-pi)
5. [Testing basic control programs](http://github.com/herolab-uga/heroswarm_v1/wiki/Testing-basic-control-programs)
6. Integration with the localization system. (to be updated)
